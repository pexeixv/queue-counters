# ![Queue Counters](img/wordmark.png)

## Details

Saw a counter software being used at a vaccination center, which guides token numbers to counters as and when they get free. Decided to implement it by myself and make improvements wherever possible.

## Features

- Gives audio instructions.
- Counter can be incremented using number keys.
- Reset counter.
- Light/dark theme.
- Data stored in `localStorage`. Data persists until cache is cleared.

## Use the app

[queue.gavinpereira.in](https://queue.gavinpereira.in)

## Todo

- Increase/decrease number of counters.
